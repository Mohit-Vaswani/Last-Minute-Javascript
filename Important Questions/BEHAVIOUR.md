# Maintain these Ethics/ Behaviour during Interview

## Speak Aloud
- The interviewer need to know what the candidate is thinking and how he/she is approaching the problem.

## Clarify the Question
- If you don't understand the question, ask for clarification. It is better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions.

## Think Out Loud
- The interviewer needs to know what you are thinking and how you are approaching the problem. If you are silent, the interviewer will not know what you are thinking.

## Proficiency in Techstack
- The interviewer is looking for your proficiency in the tech stack you have mentioned in your resume. If you are not proficient in the tech stack, don't mention it in your resume. Also the role you are applying for that particular tech stack or the language you should be proficient in.

## Don't ask for Googling
- If you don't know the answer, don't ask for Googling. The technical interview is for to judge your knowledge and not your Googling skills.
